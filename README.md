Abstract:
Gene promoter and enhancer sequences are bound by transcription factors (TFs) and depleted of methylated CpG sites.  The absence of methylated CpGs in these sequences typically correlates with increased gene expression, indicating a regulatory role for methylation.  We used nanopore sequencing to determine haplotype-specific methylation rates of 15.3 million CpG units in 7,179 whole blood genomes.  We identified 189,178 methylation depleted sequences (MDSs) where three or more proximal CpGs were unmethylated on at least one haplotype.  77,789 MDSs (~41%) associated with 80,503 cis-acting sequence variants which we termed allele-specific methylation QTLs (ASM-QTLs).  RNA sequencing of 896 samples from the same blood draws used to perform nanopore sequencing, showed that the ASM-QTL i.e., DNA sequence variability, drives most of the correlation found between gene expression and CpG methylation.  ASM-QTLs were enriched 46.4-fold (95%CI:36.0,58.7) among sequence variants associating with hematological traits, demonstrating that ASM-QTLs are important functional units in the non-coding genome.
