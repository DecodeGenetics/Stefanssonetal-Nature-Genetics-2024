This folder contains R code to determine whether a catalog of association signals e.g. ASMQTLs are significantly enriched within a given annotation of the genome, as described under "ASM-QTL in functional annotation maps" in Stefansson et al, Nat Genetics 2024. 

#1 Use make-commands.R to set up command lines for "run.R" and, if needed, "make-sparse-marker-lists.R" and "make-random-marker-lists.R". 

#2 Use annotate-signals.R to determine which association signals overlap with an annotation dataset of interest e.g., those annotations that were found to be significantly enriched among the association signals.
