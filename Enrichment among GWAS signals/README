This folder contains R code to estimate the enrichment of sequence variant annotations among GWAS signals as described in Stefansson et al, Nat Genetics 2024. 

The code depends on input data containing the association statistics of variants in high LD with a GWAS significant signals as well as a table of the genomic frequencies of each annotation within user specified minor allele frequency bins. 

The enrichment model extends the methodology presented in Sveinbjornsson et al by accounting for the different genomic frequencies of variant annotations at different minor allele frequencies.
